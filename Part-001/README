What you will learn:

A fundamental problem in JavaScript is that (1) you need to specify
the load order of JavaScript files and (2) you have no control over
when a JavaScript file is loaded.

How to use this sample:

1. Open and run the application.

2. The Console (Output window Ctrl-4 in NetBeans IDE) shows the output.

3. Go to the index file and change the load order of the two JavaScript files.

3. Notice that the application doesn't work anymore because of load order problems.

4. We will delegate the load order to 'require.js' in part 002. This is one of several problems in larger JavaScript applications, e.g., data visualization, accessibility, internationalization -- these are low-level infrastructural problems that we shouldn't need to think about as application developers. We should delegate them and focus on our business.
